I'm passionate about Computer Science and it's intricacies.I think that great software developers are passionate about coding and problem solving in general. My experience showed me that more I learn the less I know, albeit I'm curious enough to never stop pursuing it.

When I'm not reading Linux Kernel documentation or distributed systems algorithms, I like to travel, draw (far from a professional artist), read books and spend time with my friends and loved ones.
